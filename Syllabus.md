# Course Description
What is Data Science is and how can one use Big Data technologies to unlock value in massive data stores? How can one explore scientific data to gain new insights or make better data management decisions? The objective of this course is to provide an overview of the history of Data Science platforms and its current landscape in order to enable students to implement their own Data Science solution while also providing hands-on experience with these tools. The course will cover the basics of some tools that participants can subsequently use to work with Data Science, such as Hadoop's MapReduce, Apache Spark, Pig, Hive, Python, and R. In addition, the course will cover advanced data structures as well as real-world data scraping, cleansing and wrangling. The course will also include a high-level overview of machine learning concepts.
# Learning objectives:
## Technical Side: 
* Gain basic understanding of elementary concepts common in Data Science analytics: distributed file system, NoSQL databases, job scheduling, and more;
* Gain experience with integrating Data Science components into a Data Science platform, loading data, querying, and extracting value
* Gain hands-on experience connecting to and modifying installations and scripts
* Be able to rework an existing script to meet the students' needs
## Data Side:
* Learn predictive modeling: find correlations, supervised segmentation, visualization segmentation, probability estimation
* Fit a model to data and avoid overfitting: choose goals for data, loss functions, cross validation, tree pruning, regularization
* Find natural clusters and neighbors-nearest neighbor, clustering methods, distance similarity
* Pivot from thinking about data to solving a problem
* Complete a short research project using Data Science techniques and technologies

## Logistics
This is a 15-week course starting from january 31st to May 9th 2018, every Wednesday from 5:30-7:30 pm in Building 60 (Room: Rathskeller, in the basement). Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, if you need to miss a class please do come talk to us. Most classes will have hands-on tutorials and a follow-up assignment. The assignment will be due before the next class. For each class, we have recommended reading. It is the responsibility of the student to familiarize him/her-self with the material before coming to class; this will allow the student to learn at their own pace. 

## Important dates: 
* Feb 23rd  - Last day to drop
* March 30th - Last day to change status (credit or audit)
* May 9th - Classes end
* SPRING TERM HOLIDAYS	
* None.

## Discussions & Questions
Students are encouraged to use Github for discussions and questions. Students are also encouraged to help and answer fellow classmates’ questions (NOT by giving away solutions to homework questions). Such behavior will earn bonus points. 

## Required Materials
Each student must bring their own laptop to each class. 

## Recommended books
There is no required book for this course. However, we recommend reading the following freely available books:

#### Stanton, Jeffrey An Introduction to Data Science (Verison 3, 2013) (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6iefdnF22XQeVZDSkxjZ0Z5VUE/edit?pli=1)
#### Data Science for Business by F. Provost and T. Fawcett (available in print or as a free e-Book through the USU library Safari e-Books collection at http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/databases/business-intelligence/9781449374273) ISBN: 978-1449361327 
#### Data Mining for the Masses by M. North (available as a free PDF online at http://docs.rapidminer.com/downloads/DataMiningForTheMasses.pdf )
ISBN: 978-0615684376

## Assignments and Grading
Homework will account for 40% of the final grade. Homework should be uploaded to github and will be due at the beginning of the next class. The files submitted should follow the naming convention: “lastname.firstinitial.homework#”.[extension|zip prefered]

## Final project:
There will be a final project due at the end of the course, which will account for the remainder 60% of the final grade. Students will choose their own project (real-world problem, your work related problem or get creative).
It is worth 60%, so it needs to be complex - talk to us if the your project idea is “complex” enough. A short writeup on the project idea is due at the start of week 2nd class.
## Ideas:
* Find a (e.g: biology research) paper and associated data set – replicate (part of) their results
* Text mining
* Analyse a public dataset

Each student will be responsible for determining and writing up the requirements for the program (e.g: The need for the program; solves which problem; how does it solve the problem?), and making a ten minute presentation about their project to the class at the end of the semester. In addition, the student will be required to submit the program and presentation slides for grading purposes.
## Grading:
Emphasis is on learning and having fun rather than grades. Attempt (not a half-hearted one!) every problem and you will pass the course. Students are encouraged to ask questions if unclear. 	
Grading will be based on the team discussions.
## Cheating
Don’t do it! Don’t ask your homework questions on forums such as stackoverflow. Don’t use found code solely for your assignments - it will not help you learn. If you are stuck on a problem, ask for help - post the question on the google group or email us. 
## Posting Sensitive Data online
Students should not post any sensitive/classified Government Data to the web for assignments and projects.
Depending on the sensitivity of the data, it could affect the security posture of NIH and pose a career risk.
## Course Materials
Lessons will be uploaded to this repo prior to each class.
