#  Create and deploy a scoring model to predict heart failure on IBM Cloud with the Watson Data Platform

In this Code Pattern, we will use a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience to build a predictive model that demonstrates a potential health care use case.
This a customized version of the Node.js sample app that is available with the [Watson Machine Learning Service on IBM Cloud](http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/PredictiveModeling/index.html).
See the [original app](https://github.com/pmservice/predictive-modeling-samples) for a walkthrough of the source code.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook
* Deploy the model to IBM Watson Machine Learning service
* Access the Machine Learning model via either APIs or a Nodejs app

## Flow
1. The developer creates an IBM Data Science Experience Workspace.
2. IBM Data Science Experience depends on an Apache Spark service.
3. IBM Data Science Experience uses Cloud Object storage to manage your data.
4. This lab is built around a Jupyter Notebook, this is where the developer will import data, train, and evaluate their model.
5. Import data on heart failure.
6. Trained models are deployed into production using IBM's Watson Machine Learning Service.
7. A Node.js web app is deployed on IBM Cloud calling the predictive model hosted in the Watson Machine Learning Service.
8. A user visits the web app, enters their information, and the predictive model returns a response.

## Prerequisites

* An [IBM Cloud Account](https://console.bluemix.net)

* An account on [IBM Data Science Experience] (https://datascience.ibm.com).

* A space in IBM Cloud US South or United Kingdom regions.

As of 2/5/2018, the Machine Learning service on IBM Cloud is only available in the US South or United Kingdom regions.

### 1. Deploy the testing application

Use Ctrl-click on the Deploy to `IBM Cloud` button below to open the deployment process in a separate tab.

  [![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/predictive-model-on-watson-ml)

> Note:  Make sure to deploy the application to the same region and space as where the *Apache Spark* and *Cloud Object Storage* services were created when you signed up for IBM Data Science Experience. Please take note of this space as later in this lab the Watson Machine Learning service needs to be deployed into the same space.

* Click on `Deploy` to deploy the application.

  ![](doc/source/images/pipeline.png?raw=true
)

* A Toolchain and Delivery Pipeline will be created for you to pull the app out of Github and deploy it in to IBM Cloud. Click on the Delivery Pipeline tile to see the status of the deployment.

  ![](doc/source/images/toolchain.png?raw=true)

* Wait for the **Deploy Stage** to complete successfully.

  ![](doc/source/images/deploy-stage.png?raw=true)

### 2. Create an instance of the Watson Machine Learning Service

* In your browser go to the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps) and click `Catalog`.

### 4. Create a project in IBM Data Science Experience and bind it to your Watson Machine Learning service instance

* In a new browser tab go to [https://datascience.ibm.com](https://datascience.ibm.com).

* Click on `Sign In` at the top of the page.

* From the dashboard, click on `New Project` from the dashboard.

  ![](doc/source/images/new-project.png?raw=true)

* DSX projects depend on two services: Object Storage, and a Compute Engine.  If you don't already have Object Storage or a Compute Engine, you can create a new instance of each service while defining a new project.  The _New Project_ panel is easy to use, either select an existing service on the right, or create a new one.  In the example below services need to be created.

  ![](doc/source/images/create-services.png?raw=true)

> Note: Services created must be in the same region, and space, as your Data Science Experience service.

* Enter _Watson ML Integration_ as the project name and click `Create`.

* From within the new project `Overview` panel, click `Add to project` on the top right, selecting `Data asset`.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-to-project.png?raw=true)

  A panel on the right of the screen appears, select `load` and click on `Browse` to upload the data file you'll use to create a predictive model.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-data-asset.png?raw=true)

* On your machine, browse to the location of the file **patientdataV6.csv** in this repository in the **data/** directory. Select the file and click on Open (or the equivalent action for your operating system).

* Once successfully uploaded, the file should appear in the `Data Assets` section.

  ![](doc/source/images/data-assets.png?raw=true)

* Click on `Settings` for the project.

  ![](doc/source/images/settings.png?raw=true)

* Click on add associated service and select `Machine Learning`.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-associated-service.png?raw=true)

  ![Insert Spark Data Frame Step 1](doc/source/images/Picture23.png)

* Click on the `Find and Add` data icon -- see step 1 in diagram below -- and then select `Insert to code` under the file **patientdataV6.csv**. This is step 2 in diagram below. Finally select `Insert Spark Data Frame` -- which is step 3 in diagram below.

  ![](doc/source/images/insert-credentials2.png?raw=true)

> Note:  Make sure to rename the variable to `df_data` and add `.option('inferSchema','True')\`.

  ![](doc/source/images/run-notebook.png?raw=true)

* Move your cursor to each code cell and run the code in it. Read the comments for each cell to understand what the code is doing. **Important** when the code in a cell is still running, the label to the left changes to **In [\*]**:.
  Do **not** continue to the next cell until the code is finished running.

* When you get to the cell that says `Stop here !!!!` insert the username and password that you saved from your Watson Machine Learning instance into the code before running it.

  ![Run Notebook](doc/source/images/Picture27.png)

* Continue running each cell until you finish the entire notebook.

* Name the deployment _Heart Failure Prediction Model Deployment_ and click `Save`. Keep the type of deployment set to the default value 'Online'.

![](doc/source/images/create-deployment2.png?raw=true)

* Your model should now be deployed and visible as a Deployment with status 'ACTIVE'.

![](doc/source/images/create-deployment3.png?raw=true)

* Restart the Node.js Web App. For this, return to your IBM Cloud Dashboard and select the restart icon to restart the web application.

![](doc/source/images/restart-app.png?raw=true)

# Sample Output

* Click on the application URL to open the application in a separate tab.

![](doc/source/images/open-app.png?raw=true)

# Troubleshooting


# Privacy Notice
If using the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button some metrics are tracked, the following
information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service
on each deployment:

* Node.js package version
* Node.js repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Application GUID (`application_id`)
* Application instance index number (`instance_index`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the `package.json` file in the sample application and the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Cloud and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove ``require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();`` from the ``app.js`` file in the top level directory.
